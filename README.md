# P212:Cosmology--Final Project
In this project, we partially follow the work done in Ref.<sup>[1](#f1)</sup> <sup>[2](#f2)</sup> to analyze the constraints on $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ from weak lensing maps by using power spectra, peak counts, and CNN predictions. We show that CNNs have the potential to extract more information than summary statistics.
